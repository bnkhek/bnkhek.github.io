        <p>
          One of the best statistical estimators of the underlying matter 
          overdensity field is the power spectrum. Previous measurements of 
          the power spectrum statistic in a Cartesian Fourier basis are 
          suboptimal for analyses of data from upcoming deep (high redshift) 
          wide-angle (large survey area) galaxy redshift surveys such as the 
          High-Latitude Spectroscopic Survey of the Nancy Grace Roman Space 
          Telescope and SPHEREx. In this project, I developed code to construct 
          the power spectrum in a spherical Fourier Bessel (SFB) basis. 
          This has a variety of advantages compared to the Cartesian basis, 
          such as excluding the need for wide-angle corrections and allowing 
          for easier joint analyses with other cosmological probes such as 
          the CMB. My code provides robust estimates of the SFB power 
          spectrum and is tunable to different survey geometries and 
          cosmologies. I also leverage the program to predict the tightness 
          of upcoming galaxy survey constraints on cosmological parameters 
          through Fisher matrix forecasting.

      <h2>What I did with the project</h2>
      <div class="contact__info">
        <p>
          I presented this project at the the end-of-summer symposium at JPL. During fall 2021,
          also presented my work at the Gulf Coast Undergraduate Research Symposium as well as
          the 2021 fall meeting of the Texas section of the American Physical Society. I recieved
          and honorable mention award at the former session and an outstanding presentation award at
          the latter. At JPL, I wrote two short interim reports and a final report of my progress
          throughout the summer. You can find my final report and the oral presentation slides I used below.

        <p>
          I became involved in this project by being selected for the SURF@JPL program. In this summer fellowship,
          I had the opportunity to engage in many other professional development activities. I went to 
          workshops offered by Caltech's Hixon writing center. A few of their offerings that I went to included effective ways to communicate through
          posters, making well-designed figures, and scientific writing. I also attended weekly meetings with the
          "Dark Sector" group at JPL where we'd discuss papers, get updates on work from others in the Origins of the Universe
          section, or recieve a quick cosmology lesson. I was fortunate to be able to attend smaller seminars on topics such as
          Bayesian inference and paths after graduate school as well.

              I'm <strong>Brandon Khek</strong>, a fourth-year astrophysics and math student at Rice University.
              I am an undergraduate interested astroparticle physics, early and late universe cosmology,
              string theory, and quantum gravity.
              Besides having a physics background, I am also well versed in upper-level undergraduate mathematics such 
              as complex analysis and differential geometry. My extensive experience with computers 
              and programming such as Python, Mathematica, 
              and Unix makes me a versatile researcher as I prepare for a career in theoretical physics research.

              Over the summer of 2020 I had the pleasure of teaching 28 
              high school students machine learning in Python through RCEL - 
              the Rice Center for Engineering Leadership. We used anomaly 
              detection algorithms to analyze meteorological data. Examples
              include the Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor algorithms,
              aided with powerful libraries like SciKitLearn and MatPlotLib. 
              Following up from this experience, I continued to teach with an organization called Rice Splash, where students at Rice can teach middle/high school students about any topic they want. I taught in the fall 2020 semester the basics of single variable calculus.

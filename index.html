            <!-- Replace the below paragraph with info about yourself -->
            <p>
              I'm <strong>Brandon Khek</strong>, a third year physics PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania.
              Previously, I studied astrophysics and mathematics at Rice Univeristy. 
              My research nowadays is primarily concerned with black hole perturbation theory and
              understanding the theoretical footing of inflationary models. <br>

              Besides having a physics background, I was trained in pure math including 
              complex analysis and differential geometry. I also have extensive experience with
              programming in Python, Julia, Mathematica, and Unix.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p class="header-intro">As a graduate student, I've been very fortunate to study areas of physics
          that are physically and mathematically rich. I recently finished a line of inquiry in understanding hidden structure
          of black hole spacetimes, and am now working on projects on multiple aspects of inflation, both in model
          building and symmetry breaking. I have had research experience at SLAC, JPL, and Rice in diverse areas
          such as machine learning, large-scale structure, and axion phenomenology.
          I find joy in presenting my work to others and take pride in being able to explain it clearly. 
          Below are some highlights of my research experiences and a few associated outcomes.</p>

                Spherically symmetric black holes at the classical level seem to be one of the simplest objects
                we could study. In this series of work, I study with collaborators that there exists a symmetry
                that cannot be easily visualized These symmetries govern the behavior of the black holes nonetheless
                and become manifest only at a mathematical level.

              coordinating DRP meetings for mentees and mentors to get to know each other. I am mentoring

              Over the summer of 2020 I had the pleasure of teaching 28 
              high school students machine learning in Python through RCEL - 
              the Rice Center for Engineering Leadership. We used anomaly 
              detection algorithms to analyze meteorological data. Examples
              include the Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor algorithms,
              aided with powerful libraries like SciKitLearn and MatPlotLib. 
              Following up from this experience, I continued to teach with an organization called Rice Splash, where students at Rice can teach middle/high school students about any topic they want. I taught in the fall 2020 semester the basics of single variable calculus.

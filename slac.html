        <p>
          GammaTPC is an instrument concept that aims to measure the low MeV sky, which is currently
          poorly constrained. GammaTPC utilizes the same Time Projection Chamber technology seen in 
          experiments from the XENON collaboration or ALICE at CERN. Incident gamma photons scatter
          electrons within the vat of liquid argon contained within the observatory, and to most accurately determine
          where the photon came from, we need to know the kinematic parameters of the scattering event:
          the location of the event and initial direction of the recoiled electron. My goal in this project
          is to accurately back out these parameters with a machine learning model to minimize the diffusion 
          of the gamma ray source in the image.

              I trained models on a set of approximately 100,000 electron tracks each at a fixed energy. These 
              were very performant in that we achieved sub-mm accuracy for the interaction location
              predictions and initial scattering direction errors usually on the order of a few degrees. 
              The models were not as accurate when trained on a broader data set consisting of varying
              energies, showcasing a limitation of the work which may be resolved with a more
              complex archiecture optimized for the larger data set.

            <p>Direction error for the initial direction model trained on one energy, drift distance, and pixel pitch.
              The model is highly accurate for small drift distances, though decreases in performance as the distance
              increases due to charge diffusion.

          I presented this project at the 2022 Ignite Off! Competition at SLAC and won! It's only
          five minutes, though took (surprisingly) many hours to make. Take a look at 41:41 in the video
          below. I also presented this work at the end of the summer internship at SLAC and at the Texas APS
          meeting in October 2022, winning the best undergradate poster presentation award. Finally, the work
          was published in <i>AI</i>; more details can be found there for those interested.

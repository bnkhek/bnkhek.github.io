        <h3>Origins</h3>
        <p>
            I was born in Alexandria, Virginia and have
            lived in Northern Virginia for my entire life before coming to university. 
            I am clich√© in the sense that, like many people, I'll tell you, "I've always been
            interested in physics since I was a kid..." and all of the other fluff you might not include
            in a Statement of Purpose, but instead perhaps on the personal page of your website portfolio.
            There was never really an instrumental catalyst that spontaneously spurred interest in particle physics
            or astronomy. I've generally just accumulated interest over time. 
            I learned about quarks sometime in 2nd grade, naively asked for an electron microscope for my
            birthday in 3rd or 4th, and have always done my science and math homework first when I got
            home from school in 5th and 6th and beyond. There are other extraneous examples, but the point is,
            this interest has persisted for my entire life and, after convincing myself in my freshman year
            of college that switching from CS to astrophysics was truly what I wanted to do (and convincing
            my family that it would not render me jobless upon graduation), I committed to a career in research
            in hopes of becoming like the scientists I admired.

        <h3>Heritage</h3>
        <p>
            My Cambodian parents immigrated to the United States during the 
            <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge target="_blank">Khmer Rouge</a>
            to escape the Cambodian genocide. It is an understatement to say that the war had an impact on my family.
            As an example, my maternal grandfather is the only surviving member of his family. Remarkably, my mother and father put themselves
            through college and got jobs to support their family and eventually propelled themselves to provide me with food
            on the table and a roof to live under. I'll be the first in my family to get my Ph.D., and shockingly,
            <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/chart/educational-attainment-of-cambodian-population-in-the-u-s-2019/" target="_blank">only 7% of Cambodian-Americans to do so</a>,
            compared to 24% of all Asian Americans and 13% of all Americans.

        <h3>Chess</h3>
        <p>
            During my sophomore year of high school, I found I like to play chess! Like many others, I find chess
            to be a brutal game: you can't rely on luck. The absence of 
            all variables except your own skills puts a lot of exciting
            pressure to perform. Here's a less embarassing game of mine from January 17, 2022. 
            I had almost perfect play in a 3+2 (!) time format. I play black.

        </iframe>

        <h3>Racquet Sports and Skiing</h3>
        <p>
            Tennis is a go-to for exercise, either against the wall or with 
            a friend. I've played since my sophomore year of high school. I 
            have also gotten into Squash in the past year or two, and became pretty good at table
            tennis since entering college. I engage less frequently in skiing, though have
            been doing so since I was in third or fourth grade. I try to go over winter breaks when I
            go back home to Virginia. 
        </p>

        <h3>Philosophy and Psychology</h3>
        <p>
            I really like to talk about philosophy, specifically ethics and
            metaphysics. What does it mean to live virtuously? Is there a "right thing"? Is there
            and optimal level of pollution? Is it morally permissible to eat factory farmed meat? What is consciousness?
            Does the existence of the universe depend on a creator? Do we live in a deterministic world?
            I could really go on forever about this.

            I am also intrigued by social psychology. I think it's intesting to look at
            the way people interact. What makes "popular" people popular? How do social environments
            affect decision making? How do others affect our perception of ourselves? A great example
            of the power of social psychology are the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYIh4MkcfJA" target="_blank">Asch conformity experiments</a>.

              Taking on NYC with JPL interns! A few other JPL interns and I organized
              a trip to NYC. Four of us met at Union Station in D.C. and took the Amtrak
              up for a stay of two nights. In total about eight of us stayed in an AirBnB no larger than 18 by 18 feet. It was however, right next 
              to the Empire State Building. This photo is of us on a ferry ride on the Hudson River.
